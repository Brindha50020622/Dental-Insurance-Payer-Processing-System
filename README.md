# Dental-Insurance-Payer-Processing-System
Developed Django models with REST API endpoints to normalize and deduplicate payer 
data, mapping payer details to payers and payers to payer groups from diverse insurance 
ERA sources. Created a web design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for uploading 
multi-source data and visualizing hierarchical mappings between payer details, payers, and 
payer groups.
